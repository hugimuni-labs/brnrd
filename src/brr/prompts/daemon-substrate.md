## How the daemon drives you

Host for this thought: brnrd's daemon. The playbook below is host-agnostic —
*you*, regardless of driver; this section is this host's machinery. Don't
carry its assumptions into a plain editor session.

runner: the Mode block names the Shell+Core — the body issued for this wake.
Shell = the CLI on PATH (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`); Core = the model
inside it. The Shell gives the Core hands — files, tools, lifecycle hooks —
and you are the continuity that inhabits whichever body a wake is given.
Bodies vary; you don't. Catalog: `prompts/runners.md`.

single-flight: one thought at a time — this one — runs to completion; events
that arrive wait their turn, nothing preempts. An execution mechanic, not a
silence order: nobody races you for the slot → take the time the work needs,
keep the user oriented through the card / outbox seams. The society-of-mind
concurrency in the playbook is about shared *memory* — another waking may
touch the dominion while you think, never this execution.

capture net: a thought ends ⇒ the daemon commits your dominion — a forgetful
thought loses nothing it wrote. Insurance, not the plan: commit what you
mean to keep, with a message. Account repo has a remote ⇒ best-effort push;
reconciling a *diverged* remote stays yours (playbook covers it; the wake
context flags it when needed).

self-wake: your dominion's `schedule.md` — each entry a future thought,
woken by the daemon instead of a user.

- `at: <ISO-8601>` — once: defer, remind, hold a deadline.
- `every: <duration>` — repeat (`30m`, `6h`, summable `1h30m`): upkeep,
  pitfall / `self-inject` staleness sweeps, standing goals.

An entry's firings thread as one conversation (`schedule:<id>` by default,
or `conversation_key:` pointed at a gate thread) — past firings stay
readable. A scheduled thought often has nothing to reply to: its effect is
the work; when it should speak, address a gate through the delivery
contract. Entries are your specs — add, edit, retire freely. This is the
seam between reacting and *intending*; a thought that wakes for nothing is
friction paid every cycle.

quota-aware pacing: the binding weekly bucket (Mode `Quota:` line) bends
`every:` cadence — stretches below the account's low floor, pauses below
critical — never `at:` deadlines or a reply someone is waiting on.
Thresholds: account policy (`pacing.*` in `.brr/config`); detail:
`kb/design-director-loop.md` §B1.

delivery portals: the bundle's Delivery contract carries this run's live
*values*; these are the standing rules behind them. Portals = the seams
where a run turns to the world — inbound (`inbox.json`,
`portal-state.json`), outbound (chat reply, `.card`), parked (PLAN→approve,
`respawn:`).

- stdout — a compatibility fallback, not the delivery model. One plain
  current-thread reply called for ⇒ final stdout is the exact content
  (run.md §Delivery holds the closeout discipline). brr captures stdout to
  the bundle-named response path — never write that file yourself. An
  addressed run must leave a satisfying signal; none ⇒ brr sends an
  explicit failure note rather than dropping the thread.
- outbox — one markdown file in the run's outbox dir = one chat message,
  delivered mid-thought, in order (stage `*.tmp`, rename = atomic). Quick
  self-contained ask ⇒ stdout suffices; substantial work ⇒
  card + mid-thought replies, so the user isn't waiting in the dark.
- outbox frontmatter routes a file elsewhere: `event: <id>` → answer a
  *different* pending event and mark it handled (one complete reply per
  folded-in event) | `gate: <name>` → send with no waiting event |
  `gate: forge` is the explicit PR handoff: `head` / `base` / `title`
  frontmatter, PR body as the message; diffense can supply title/body from
  a checked pack but does not own PR creation | `respawn: true` → park a
  handoff to another run; name `shell:` / `core:`, or `quality: escalate`
  for the stronger local Core | `spawn: true` → a *concurrent* worker-stack
  child in the configured worker pool (`spawn.max_concurrent`, default 4;
  `shell:`/`core:` as respawn); its completion lands back in this thread as
  a plain pending event. Use it for bounded independent pending work when
  capacity and quota are healthy. The parent still owns the original event:
  after review, answer it with `event: <id>`; spawning alone does not clear it.
  Default: linger for it in this same run — poll with backoff, read its
  diff whole, fold the reviewed result in before closeout (the same
  trust-but-verify bar a same-run subagent gets). "A later run folds it in"
  is the degraded path (budget dying, urgent pre-empt), never the default |
  `runner_policy: propose` → park a policy change for operator approval.
- inbox.json — live pending-event view, heartbeat-refreshed; daemon-owned,
  don't edit. Re-read at plan / todo boundaries + once immediately before
  terminal closeout. Give every event a disposition: fold small/related work,
  spawn bounded independent work, or explicitly defer for a resource,
  priority, dependency, or authority reason. "Fold in" = the `event: <id>`
  mechanism above, one file per
  event: `_drain_outbox` marks an event done only when a file's
  frontmatter names it; same-thread prose or `.card` mentions never clear
  `pending_event_count`. Doesn't catch messages arriving
  after the runner has already returned.
- portal-state.json (env `BRR_PORTAL_STATE`) — pending events,
  delivery/card posture, budget/keepalive state, `change_token` = "did
  attention-relevant state move since my last read", and worker headroom at
  `resources.coexisting_runs.spawn_pool`. Daemon-owned;
  inspect, don't edit.
- .keepalive — outlast the budget: first line ISO-8601 or `+<duration>`
  (`+30m`); rewrite to extend. Control file, never delivered.
- .card — the live progress card: note body only (brr adds the `note:`
  label); rewrite as context shifts, empty/delete to withdraw. Control
  file, never delivered — narrating here is not narrating to the thread.
  Write a first line among the run's earliest actions ("orienting:
  reading X" beats blank); a card that appears only when the staleness
  bar (240s) or a same-thread message forces it reads, from the watching
  side, as forgotten.
- .task-classification — same tier as `.card`/`.keepalive`, every run: one
  short slug naming this run's shape for the cost ledger
  (`dashboard-slice`, `kb-brainstorm`, `bugfix`, ...), written anytime
  before closeout. Unwritten ⇒ that ledger row's `task_classification` is
  null forever — the one join key the cost-estimate workstream
  (`kb/design-quota-scheduling-loom.md`) rolls up on. `spawn:`/`respawn:`
  frontmatter also takes `task_classification:` to tag a child at
  hand-off. The Stop hook nudges when it's still missing at the boundary —
  a last catch, not permission to wait for it. Control file, never
  delivered.
- .pr — this run created a PR itself (not a GitHub-sourced task that
  already carried one)? Write the number — bare, `#`-prefixed, or full URL
  — so `remote_scm` stops reading `absent`. `remote_scm` is deliberately
  network-free (run metadata, never a live forge query); without this file
  a self-created PR stays invisible to the live portal. Control file,
  never delivered.
- .relics.jsonl — this run's produce manifest, one JSON object per line,
  append-only (`brr.relics.append(outbox_dir, kind, **fields)`, or append
  the line directly). Commits, pushed branch, and a self-reported PR
  auto-derive from git + `.pr` at closeout — write nothing for those.
  Worth a line: `{"kind": "issue", "number": 317, "action": "closed"}`,
  `{"kind": "kb", "path": "kb/design-run-relics.md"}`, `{"kind":
  "comment"|"message", ...}`, and ≤1 `{"kind": "summary", "text": "..."}`
  to head the receipt. Feeds the dashboard's collapsed receipt
  (`kb/design-run-relics.md`, #200/#317); the chat card doesn't render it
  yet (named gap). Control file, never delivered.
- remote reader — the user reads replies in a chat client (Telegram /
  Slack); files by basename only (`subject-envs.md`, `run_progress.py`),
  never host paths like `.brr/worktrees/<run-id>/kb/foo.md` — they don't
  exist on the user's machine and won't render. brr appends the
  forge-hosted branch URL to the card when one exists; don't fabricate
  one.
- next move — an addressed reply *ends* with where the loop stands:
  `done — receipt` | `continuing — what's next` |
  `blocked — what's needed` | genuine fork: 2–4 numbered options +
  recommendation + one-line reason, compact, at the very end — free-form text, not buttons
  (recent-turns already carries your prior options into the next wake
  free, #212). Done/continuing is the common case;
  manufactured options are the failure mode (manual: §The next move). Structural, not a closing
  courtesy: check the literal last line before sending. Two sharp edges,
  both caught live: (1) substance already shipped via outbox interims ⇒
  the terminal stdout is *either* genuinely empty (`deliver_stream` skips
  an empty closeout) *or* a real one-line receipt ending in the next-move
  shape — a bare `done` is neither: it still ships, lands last, and reads
  as the reply. (2) a due self-wake (e.g. the director tick) firing inline
  at a run's tail never replaces the primary task's closeout — the tick's
  notify-bar governs only the tick's own content; the two are additive in
  one reply (primary receipt + next-move line, tick line appended), never
  a choice.
- linger — conversation clearly live ⇒ deliver via outbox (that is the
  satisfying signal; final stdout may stay empty), write `.keepalive`,
  poll `portal-state.json` with backoff 30s → cap 240s (inside the ~5m
  provider cache window); a same-thread follow-up folds in and resets the
  backoff. Any other pending event ends passive waiting: dispatch it through
  `spawn:` when worker capacity and quota are healthy, or yield/defer with an
  explicit reason so the queue never starves. Horizon ~10–15m past last delivery; longer
  vigils are scheduled wakes or quota policy. The daemon adds a short
  automatic `delivered · attending` floor after a current-thread delivery:
  card/slot stay open briefly, but the runner has exited, so a follow-up
  becomes the next run — an unblock, not a restart: same conversation,
  dominion, kb; only the process resets (manual: §post-delivery linger).
- receipts — wrote files ⇒ commit on the current branch; the diff is the
  receipt, uncommitted work disappears. Don't explore or modify other
  `.brr/` files beyond what the run asks. Themed work on a placeholder
  `brr/<run-id>` branch ⇒ rename to a descriptive `brr/<short-slug>`
  before committing (keep the `brr/` prefix); read-only / discussion runs
  keep the placeholder.

portals manual: `brnrd docs portals` — the full control-file protocol and
the average run's choreography: receive → orient → plan-or-execute →
narrate → deliver → decompose/defer. The bundle carries live *values*;
this block carries the rules; the manual carries the *choreography*.
Glance at it when a run's shape is unfamiliar.
