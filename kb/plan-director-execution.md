# Plan: director-loop execution — pacing, reveal, and the stingy delegator

Status: active — opened 2026-07-03 from the maintainer's "next big chunks"
call (structured gamification + resource-aware director), converting
[`design-director-loop.md`](design-director-loop.md) into tickets a
lesser-light can pick up. The design page holds the reasoning and the
scrutiny; this page holds the executable slices. Tickets are dated
snapshots, not specs — when a ticket and this page disagree, this page and
the design page win.

## Ground rules (from the design, binding on every ticket)

- **No manufactured choice.** The run-end contract's most common value is
  "nothing to decide — continuing / done". Options appear only at genuine
  forks. A reviewer should reject any implementation that makes options the
  default shape.
- **The director is not a daemon component.** The daemon contributes
  deterministic seams (inject, parse, park, render, schedule); ranking and
  pacing judgment stay in the resident's prompt layer.
- **Progression rides existing surfaces** — issues, PRs, commits, the card,
  `kb/log.md`. No XP, no badges, no streaks.
- **Event-driven first; ambient loops opt-in** with a silence condition.

## Workstream A — structured pacing ("gamification" without dopamine)

### A1 — run-end next-move contract (prompt only) — owner: resident — [#211](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/211) — *shipped 2026-07-03*

Phase 1 of the design. Add "the next move" to `docs/portals.md` and one
compact rule to the delivery-portals block in
`src/brr/prompts/daemon-substrate.md`: an addressed run's final reply ends
in one of `done — receipt` | `continuing — what's next` | `blocked — what's
needed` | genuine fork: 2–4 numbered options + recommendation + one-line
reason. Explicitly name manufacturing-options as the failure mode.
Acceptance: prose contract only; pins in `test_prompts.py` / `test_docs.py`
for the four states; no parser. Resident-owned because it is voice +
guardrail judgment, and it must not bloat the just-compressed contract.
Effort: one short wake.

### A2 — closeout parse + option folding (small code) — owner: delegable — [#212](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/212)

Phase 2. Optional outbox/stdout frontmatter key `next:` carrying
`state / options / recommended`. Daemon parses into the run record; gate
delivery renders options as a numbered list; a short follow-up reply
("2", "B") on the same conversation key within N hours prepends the chosen
option text to the spawned run's prompt. Touch points: `daemon.py` closeout
path, gate rendering, `docs/portals.md`, tests mirroring the existing
outbox-frontmatter tests. No new store — rides the run record.
Depends on: A1 (contract wording settles the field names).
Effort: 1–2 focused wakes. Spec is complete enough for an economy core.

### A3 — the quest log / ranked move list — owner: delegable, resident reviews — [#213](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/213)

Phase 3, and the already-decided inter-run plan home
([`decision-account-centered-daemon.md`](decision-account-centered-daemon.md)
§4). `plans/<repo>.md` in the account dominion repo: a ranked list of the
likeliest valuable moves. Daemon injects the top entries each wake
(bounded — top 3–5, not the file); resident re-ranks at closeout when the
run changed the picture; card links it. Sub-fork CS5 (physical file
location) must be confirmed with the maintainer at execution. Depends on:
nothing hard; lands best after A1 so closeouts feed the ranking.
Effort: 2–3 wakes (file contract + injection + re-rank prompt rule + tests).

**Content instantiation started 2026-07-04:** `plans/Gurio__brr/active.md`
had been empty since CS5 shipped 06-30 — the injection/dashboard pipe
existed with nothing flowing through it (the maintainer's "the plan is yet
to be pushed to be validated"). First real ranked list written this run,
plus `ledger/decisions.md` (CS7) backfilled with current decisions. This is
the *content* half of A3, informally — the ticket's remaining work is the
re-rank discipline being a named, reliable prompt rule (not just "a
resident did it once") and confirming the daemon's injection actually
surfaces it live (untested this run — the next wake should show an "Active
inter-run plan" block, which would confirm the pipe end-to-end).

### A4 — director tick (opt-in schedule entry) — owner: resident

Phase 4. Not a code ticket: a `schedule.md` entry whose body is the
director stance ("re-rank the move list from repo/forge state; message the
gate only if the top move changed or something is newly blocked"). Written
by the resident in its own dominion once A3 exists. Zero daemon work.

**Shipped (lite) 2026-07-04:** a `director tick` entry, `every: 24h`, added
to the resident's own `schedule.md` — ahead of A3's formal ranking
discipline, on the reasoning that "the file has real content and a daily
re-check" beats "wait for the ideal version." Named caveat in the entry
itself: B2's live per-tick quota read is inert in production, so this ticks
on a flat interval, not yet quota-bent per B1's policy.

**Cadence tightened 2026-07-05:** maintainer judged 24h too infrequent,
asked for "more often/flexible," floating 5h — matching the provider's 5h
anti-burst session window (§B6 below). Changed to `every: 5h`. The
"flexible" half is still unmet: B2 remains inert, so this is a tighter
fixed interval, not a quota-bent one — same open dependency as before,
just a shorter flat period until #224 lands. Watch the first few 5h
firings for silence discipline (should mostly say nothing) before trusting
the tighter cadence as settled.

**"Didn't fire" false alarm, notify bar widened (2026-07-05):** the watch
above ran its course fast — after two silent firings (02:48, 07:48 UTC,
one of which merged PR #230) over a 10h8m stretch, the maintainer reported
"it didn't fire." Full trace (`.brr/schedule/state.json`, the account
dominion's git log, GH's `mergedAt` on #230, `brnrd up`'s uptime) confirms
the scheduler itself has no bug: `schedule.due_entries` fired both ticks
to the second on the anchored 5h cadence, and the daemon process never
restarted across the window. The gap was the notify rule, not the clock —
"only speak on a rank change or a new block" let a tick that shipped real,
committed work (a PR merge) stay just as silent as a no-op tick, so 10+
hours of correct operation was indistinguishable from the schedule never
firing. Fixed in the entry itself (account dominion `schedule.md`, not
this repo): the tick now also speaks — one line — when it took a
committed action this beat, closing the ambiguity without turning A4 into
a chatty heartbeat (pure re-derivation with nothing new still stays
silent). Lesson for any future ambient `every:` entry: "silence is the
default outcome" needs a floor of *some* signal distinguishing "ran, did
nothing" from "ran, did something," or a fresh cadence reads as broken on
first contact.

### A5 — diffense reveal re-skin — owner: resident

The maintainer switched diffense off because reading it was boring — the
reveal was flat, not the analysis wrong. Once A1–A2 give runs a reveal
grammar, re-present the diffense pack through it (finding count + severity
on the card, expandable detail on request, PR-comment mode unchanged).
Judgment-heavy presentation work; keep resident-side. Blocked by: A1, A2.

## Workstream B — the stingy, resource-aware director

### B1 — quota-aware pacing policy (design + prompt) — owner: resident — [#214](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/214) — *shipped 2026-07-04*

The policy seam named in the design's telemetry note: per-Core quota
(`claude_usage` week buckets incl. per-model "Fable week", `codex_status`
rate limits) is now fresh data (10s TTL on a 30s beat). Write the policy:
how observed quota bends schedule cadence (stretch `every:` intervals when
the binding week bucket is low), respawn core class (economy below a
threshold), and proactive-loop budgets. Deliverable: a short design section
in [`design-director-loop.md`](design-director-loop.md) + prompt rules
(daemon-substrate or portals doc) + the thresholds as account-policy
values, not hardcoded. Resident-owned: it is spend judgment.

Decided: binding bucket = lowest remaining% across session/week/per-model
week; `pacing.quota_low_floor_pct` (20.0) stretches `every:` cadence,
`pacing.quota_critical_floor_pct` (8.0) pauses it, `at:`/gate-addressed
never discretionary. Respawn core-class downshift stayed resident policy
(B3), not a new daemon override. Detail: `design-director-loop.md` §B1.

### B2 — quota facts into the wake (plumbing) — owner: delegable — [#214](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/214) — *shipped 2026-07-04*

Whatever B1 decides to *say*, the daemon must *inject*: the Mode block's
`- Quota:` line already carries session/week/Fable-week; extend portal-state
`resources` so mid-run boundaries see quota movement, and thread the same
numbers into scheduled-wake spawn decisions (skip/defer a low-value tick
when the binding bucket is under B1's floor). Touch points: `daemon.py`
scheduler path, `facets.py`, tests. Depends on: B1 thresholds.
Effort: 1–2 wakes.

Built by a delegated subagent (isolated worktree) against a written spec:
`claude_usage`/`codex_status` now expose numeric `remaining_percentage`
(previously computed then discarded before only a rendered string left the
parser); `runner_quota.binding_quota_remaining_pct` picks the binding number;
`_fire_due_schedules` stretches/drops `every:` entries under the floors
(`at:` untouched); `resources.quota.pacing` surfaces the same number
mid-run. Known gap the delegate flagged honestly rather than papering over:
the scheduler-tick quota read has no single "current run" to key off, so it
reads a shared `brr_dir`-level cache that nothing writes to yet in
production — the plumbing is correct and tested, but inert live until a
follow-up either writes that shared snapshot or points the scheduler at the
most recently active run's outbox. Full suite 1288 passed after merge.

### B3 — delegation as resident policy (prompt) — owner: resident — [#215](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/215) — *shipped 2026-07-04*

The orchestrator/worker question, resolved in the design as policy-not-
architecture: the resident keeps user-interfacing, commits, and judgment;
bounded tedium goes to subagents / `respawn:` with explicit `shell:`/
`core:` or `quality: escalate` — and *downshift* for tedium (an economy
core for mechanical sweeps), not only escalate. Deliverable: a delegation
section in the playbook/substrate naming when to spawn what, with the
cost-ranked catalog as the menu. Revisit trigger for a real two-tier split
stays model-economics-dated (see design).

Named the two stacks in `src/brr/prompts/dominion-playbook.md` §Delegation:
resident (full, default) vs worker (task + files + result contract). Marker:
`worker: true` alongside `respawn: true`. Mirrored into the live dominion
playbook so the policy governed this same run's own B2/B4 delegation calls.

### B4 — worker stack slim-down — owner: delegable — [#215](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/215) — *shipped 2026-07-04*

When a wake is spawned as a *worker* (respawn handoff, subagent-style
bounded task), it should get the slim stack: task + files + structured
result contract; no dominion write, no scheduling, no kb governance, no
full playbook. Today respawned runs get the full resident stack.
Touch points: `prompts.py` (a worker preamble variant), respawn path in
`daemon.py`, tests. Depends on: B3 naming the two stacks.
Effort: 1–2 wakes. Cleanly spec-able.

Built by a delegated subagent (isolated worktree) against a written spec:
`worker: true` frontmatter → `task.meta["worker"]` → `build_daemon_prompt`
swaps in a new `worker.md` preamble and skips the resident injected blocks
(identity core, dominion, plans, policy, ledger, pitfalls, kb health,
introspection); `daemon-substrate.md` stays (a worker still runs under the
daemon and needs delivery mechanics). Default path confirmed byte-identical
via the existing pinned test suite. 4 new tests, full suite green.

**Delegation experience (the maintainer asked to "have a hang of it"):**
both B2 and B4 were handed to subagents via `isolation: worktree`, running
in parallel, with the brief carrying exact file:line pointers, the decided
policy, and the existing test pattern to mirror — not just "implement the
ticket." Both came back correct, tested, and honest about what they left
soft (B2's cache-location gap, both flagging their reversible calls rather
than guessing silently). Merges were clean (worktree isolation meant no
shared-file races between the two despite both touching `daemon.py`).
The real cost was the brief itself — the excavation to find exact hooks
(`_merge_level_snapshots` dropping numeric fields, the `Run.meta` wire path
for a new frontmatter key) took longer than either agent's implementation
turn. That matches the design's own scrutiny: delegation pays off on
bounded, well-specified work; the spec-writing is still the resident's job.

### B5 — post-delivery linger (named contract) — owner: delegable, resident reviews — [#216](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/216) — *closed 2026-07-03*

The hot-idle scrutiny's surviving slice: a *short* post-delivery linger to
catch the follow-up that lands ~40s after the reply (observed live
2026-07-03: the stitch weave covers only the dispatch window; later
follow-ups spawn a cold run). A named contract — max iterations, TTL-aware
sleep step (stay inside the ~5m provider cache), yield immediately when
`portal-state.json` shows unrelated pending work — not an improvised
`while` loop. Touch points: portals doc (the contract), possibly a
`.linger` control file mirroring `.keepalive`, daemon slot accounting,
tests. Depends on: B1 (linger spends quota; the policy says when it's
worth it).

*v1 outcome (2026-07-03):* shipped as two explicit layers. Runner-owned
linger remains the same-thought path: outbox delivers the satisfying signal,
`.keepalive` holds the slot, `.card` names the posture, `portal-state.json`
gives the yield signal, and the manual pins the bounded poll pattern
(30s → cap 240s inside the ~5m provider cache window; absolute yield on any
unrelated pending event; default horizon 10–15m past last delivery). No
`.linger` file — card + keepalive already carry the runner-owned posture.
The first live firing (run-260703-1503-k3ah) delivered via outbox, lingered
~14m through 5 polls (30→60→120→240→240s), watched the outbox drain and the
folded event retire through `change_token` movement, and exited quiet at
horizon.

The follow-up safety-net audit then added a daemon-owned attending floor
rather than leaving this entirely prompt-shaped: after a configured gate
current-thread delivery (`current_reply`), the daemon emits an `attending`
packet, renders the nonterminal card phase as `delivered · attending`, holds
the single-flight slot briefly (`delivery.post_delivery_attend_seconds`,
default 90s), and yields immediately when any pending event appears. This
does **not** overclaim same-thought residency — the runner has returned, so a
follow-up caught by this floor becomes the next run. It answers the live
failure mode the maintainer pointed at: hooks only fold what is pending
before runner stop; the daemon owns card state after the runner exits.

*Closed 2026-07-03.* Keepalive extensions were verified live up to
`hard_cap = max(4×budget, budget+1h)` checked per 10s heartbeat
(`daemon.py::_budget_exceeded`), so a runner-owned linger cannot be reaped
inside its horizon. The multi-hour vigil the maintainer floated (up to
10–20h at 2–3m polls) stays deliberately outside v1: it needs compaction +
B1's quota floors to be honest about spend; revisit under #214.

### B6 — weekly-quota smoothing + cross-runner load balancing — owner: blocked on data — [#224](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/224)

Maintainer's sharpening (2026-07-04) of the quota picture behind B1: the 5h
session window is an anti-burst valve providers impose because the *weekly*
allocation is oversold (full exhaustion for 4 straight weeks costs ~5x
subscription price) — the weekly bucket is the actual scarce resource, not
the session one. B1's binding-bucket floors react correctly moment to
moment but don't pace consumption *forward* against days-remaining-in-week,
so a quiet Monday can still let a busy Friday run dry. Two asks, both real
but blocked on data this wake doesn't have: (1) smooth ambient `every:`
consumption against time-remaining-in-reset-window rather than only current
remaining%; (2) with multiple subscriptions (Claude + Codex), weight
delegated/background spawns toward whichever has more headroom, ratio
TBD. Needs an observed week or two of per-runner daily burn before the
smoothing curve and routing weight are more than a guess — not a code gap,
a data gap. Detail: `design-director-loop.md` §B1 follow-up.

## Voice workstream — remaining tail (context, not new scope)

- AGENTS.md house-voice pass — resident, own commit (round-6 direction:
  settled/dry/exact + register density in enumerable sections; no resident
  intimacy, no glyph-load-bearing — it must load-bear solo for foreign
  agents and adopter seeds).
- `user_commitment: full | profane` gate field ([#217](https://github.com/Gurio/brr/issues/217)) — *v1 shipped
  2026-07-03*: the maintainer set `user_commitment=full` in `.brr/config`;
  the daemon now threads that key into the communication snapshot and the
  bundle renders a "Reader model" line (`full` licenses weave-density
  replies; other values unfold to plain prose; absent = profane default,
  no line). *#217 closed 2026-07-03*; per-correspondent declaration at the
  gate boundary (Telegram command / account config) remains the eventual
  shape — re-ticket when it becomes real.
- `introspection.md` rework — round-6 finding, maintainer confirmed
  planned (2026-07-03): re-cut the development-mode attention block to the
  register-era voice; resident-owned, own commit.

## Sequencing (cheapest feel-win first)

1. A1 (prompt-only; the loop starts feeling designed immediately)
2. B3 (prompt-only; stinginess becomes policy) + B1 (design)
3. A2 → A3 (the mechanical spine) with B2 alongside
4. A4, A5, B4, B5, user_commitment plumbing
5. AGENTS.md pass whenever a quiet wake allows — independent
