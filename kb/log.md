## [2026-04-07] implement | Initial setup

Set up AGENTS.md and knowledge base structure.

## [2026-04-07] plan | Concurrent worktree-based task execution

Designed a multi-phase plan for replacing the serial daemon loop with concurrent
task execution using git worktrees. Key components: `worktree.py` (lifecycle),
`pool.py` (worker pool + merge coordinator), daemon v2 loop. Each task gets an
isolated worktree on a `brr/<event-id>` branch, merged back sequentially.
Full plan in `kb/plan-concurrent-worktrees.md`.

## [2026-04-07] research | Branch & review strategy for agent commits

Explored how to make agents use branches/PRs instead of committing to main.
Proposed a tiered approach: (1) default: branch-and-wait (universal, just git),
(2) enhanced: branch-and-PR when `gh`/`glab` detected, (3) opt-in: direct commit
via `review=false` config. This aligns with the worktree plan — branches already
exist, just need a review gate before merging. Key decisions still open: how
AGENTS.md should express this (generic vs injected), and notification mechanism
when no PR tooling is available.

## [2026-04-08] plan | Reconciling worktree vs. existing-branch modes

Designed a unified approach for two execution cases: (A) orchestrator-managed
worktree isolation for new tasks, and (B) project-managed existing branches
(e.g., Linear ticket branches). Core insight: the agent instruction is the same
("commit on current branch") — the difference is orchestrator setup. Key
decisions: `branch` event field selects mode (auto/current/<name>), state files
are injected into prompts rather than copied into worktrees, kb/log.md
responsibility shifts to orchestrator in worktree mode to avoid merge conflicts.
Mode-specific prompt templates override base AGENTS.md instructions where needed.
Full plan in `kb/plan-branch-modes.md`.

## [2026-04-08] plan | v2 revision of branch modes & concurrent worktrees

Major revision of both plans based on user feedback. Key changes:
(1) Branch is now a task property (not event property) — runner creates a Task
from an event and the task spec carries the branch strategy, offloading the
decision to the agent. (2) Per-task log files (`kb/log-<task-id>.md`) replace
the orchestrator-written-log approach — agents write normally, orchestrator
squashes post-merge, zero conflict risk. (3) `needs_context` is a first-class
task outcome — agent can successfully exit asking for more info. (4) Execution
environment abstraction (local/worktree/docker) with `env` field on task.
(5) AGENTS.md stays generic, mode-specific overrides via prompt injection.
(6) Branch creation is a supported flow (not an error).
Updated `kb/plan-branch-modes.md` (v2) and `kb/plan-concurrent-worktrees.md` (v2).

## [2026-04-08] implement | Task abstraction, context injection, triage prompt

Implemented three connected features from the v2 plans:

1. **Task dataclass** (`src/brr/task.py`): Event → Task conversion with branch
   strategy, env type, status (including `needs_context`), persistence to
   `.brr/tasks/`, and branch name resolution. The triage agent decides the
   branch property when converting events into tasks.

2. **Conversation context injection** (`runner.py`): Recent kb/log.md entries
   are now injected into every agent prompt, giving session-to-session continuity
   without manual context sharing. Capped at 10 most recent entries to prevent
   prompt bloat. The log is agent-maintained per AGENTS.md conventions.

3. **Triage prompt** (`prompts/triage.md`): Template for the agent that converts
   raw events into Task specs (deciding branch strategy and execution environment).

4. **Daemon integration** (`daemon.py`): Worker now creates and persists Tasks,
   tracks status throughout execution, and detects `needs_context` responses.

Closed open question #4 (task persistence) in both plan documents.
All 56 tests pass (26 new).

## [2026-04-10] fix | Use non-interactive Codex runner

Updated the built-in `codex` runner profile to use `codex exec --full-auto`
instead of the interactive `codex --full-auto` path, which was failing under
the daemon with `stdout is not a terminal`. Added a regression test covering
the generated Codex command.

## [2026-04-10] fix | Make Codex daemon writes reliable

Troubleshot a second Codex daemon failure where runs exited successfully but
never created `.brr/responses/<event>.md`. Root cause: Codex's default sandbox
was blocked on this Linux host (`bwrap ... Operation not permitted`), and brr
also relied on the agent manually writing the response file. Updated daemon
invocations to pass Codex `--output-last-message <response-path>` and to append
`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` when `auto_approve=true`, plus
clarified the daemon prompt and added regression coverage.

## [2026-04-10] review | PR #1 task abstraction review

Reviewed PR #1 deeply against the code path actually exercised by the daemon.
Found a larger gap where the new triage prompt is present but not wired into
execution, so branch/env are still not agent-decided in practice. Also fixed
two concrete issues in the working tree: daemon event files now preserve the
real task outcome (`needs_context` / `error` instead of always `done`), and
`Task.from_event()` now honors explicit event `branch` / `env` overrides.
Added daemon and task regression tests and recorded the review in
`kb/review-pr-1.md`. Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src pytest` because the current
virtualenv imports `brr` from `.venv/site-packages` rather than `src/`.

## [2026-04-14] fix | Wire daemon triage into task execution

Fixed the remaining PR #1 review gap by making the daemon run a real triage
step before execution instead of creating tasks directly from raw events.
Triage output is now parsed into a persisted `Task`, malformed triage output
fails closed with task/event status `error`, and branch/env/body decisions now
actually affect execution. Also reduced duplicated prompt assembly in
`runner.py`, clarified the triage prompt's branch/env relationship, and added
regression coverage for valid and invalid triage output. Verified with
`PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/test_task.py tests/test_runner.py tests/test_daemon.py`.

## [2026-04-14] review | Concurrency follow-up review

Re-reviewed the code after the triage wiring change, focusing on whether the
planned merge coordinator and concurrent worktree execution now exist in code.
Conclusion: task branch/env/needs-context scaffolding is implemented and
coherent, but the actual concurrency path is still not present — no
`worktree.py`, `pool.py`, merge-back flow, or daemon pool dispatch yet, and
`daemon.py` remains serial v1. Recorded the review in
`kb/review-concurrency-followup-2026-04-14.md`, clarified what "concurrent
execution" means in the plan, and recommended deferring cancellation until
after the worktree/pool path exists.

## [2026-04-14] fix | Make worktree tasks execute on real branches

Implemented the first runtime slice from the concurrency follow-up review.
`daemon.py` now creates a real git worktree when a triaged task requires one,
runs the agent in that isolated checkout, and finalizes the branch explicitly
after success. Auto/task branches are merged back to the current branch via a
new `gitops.merge_branch()` helper, while named branches are preserved and only
their temporary worktree is removed. Added `src/brr/worktree.py` for worktree
lifecycle management plus daemon/git regression tests. Verified with
`PYTHONPATH=src pytest`.

## [2026-04-14] fix | Trace runner invocations and validate outputs consistently

Added a runner-level invocation contract in `runner.py` with explicit required
artifacts, validation status, and retry reasons, then persisted each invocation
under `.brr/traces/<kind>/...` with the prompt, stdout/stderr, metadata, and
copies of produced required files. Updated daemon execution and triage to use
that contract so response retries derive from missing validated artifacts rather
than ad hoc file checks, and updated `brr init` to validate AGENTS/kb outputs
through the same interface. Added regression coverage for trace persistence,
missing-output validation, daemon retries, and init/integration call sites.
Verified with `PYTHONPATH=src pytest`.

## [2026-04-20] plan | Fleet & steering design (overlays, brnrd, envs)

Took the personal-workflow-variants idea to a full three-axis design and
delivered two Marp decks as consulting-style artefacts:
`kb/deck-brr-current.md` (bird's-eye of the system today: file protocol,
pipeline, CLI surface, where state lives, current override model) and
`kb/deck-brr-fleet-steering.md` (the future design).

Locked decisions: single-slot overlay profile, pull-on-next-run, overlay scope
= prompts + config defaults (not docs), `~/.config/brr/` ownership, worktree
demoted to one env among several with no concurrent pool in v1, fleet UX ships
as `brnrd` (registry + broadcaster first; supervisor daemon later).

Recommended roadmap: Phase 1 overlays (~200 LOC), Phase 2 `brnrd` registry +
`brnrd all`, Phase 3 `Env` protocol refactor, Phase 4 first non-worktree env
(docker) + optional `brnrd up` supervisor. Phase 1 alone unblocks the
one-edit-N-repos-converge demo that sells the whole thesis. Marked
`idea-personal-workflow-variants.md` as absorbed into the new decks.
No code changes; read-only design pass.

## [2026-04-20] plan | Fleet & steering v2 — git-backed overlay + env parallelism correction

Revised `kb/deck-brr-fleet-steering.md` after user review. Two changes:
(1) Blessed overlay transport is now a git clone of a user-owned repo, making
overlays remote-editable (push from phone/web IDE; fleet converges via
`overlay_sync=auto|always|never` and `brnrd overlay sync`). Added a dedicated
slide and updated the gitlab demo to showcase push-based rollout. (2) Corrected
the parallelism framing in A3: concurrency is *not* a property of the env type.
All non-local envs are ephemeral by construction, so every env shares the same
durability contract (commit + push + response in `finalize`), and real
parallelism is gated by the merge coordinator above the Env layer — not by
whether the env is worktree, docker, or kube. Added a "durability contract"
slide and a "where parallelism lives" slide with a mermaid diagram. Roadmap
gained Phase 5 "merge coordinator → true concurrency" decoupled from env work.
Updated decisions-locked table (overlay transport, env model, parallelism
source rows added) and the idea-page resolution section. Still read-only.

## [2026-04-20] plan | Refocus on envs; capture pondering for overlays/brnrd

Pivoted the active work from the strategic three-axis design back onto the
in-flight worktree PR. New `kb/design-env-interface.md` is the actionable
spec to finish that PR: extract an `Env` Protocol with `prepare/invoke/finalize`,
codify the durability contract (only git refs + the response file survive an
ephemeral env), ship four built-ins (`local`, `worktree`, `docker`, `ssh`),
and replace the deferred "merge coordinator" with a decentralised model —
every task produces a branch, `auto`/`task` strategies attempt
`git merge --ff-only` with a `conflict` fallback, named branches stay for
human/PR review. Third-party envs ship via the `brr.envs` entry-point group.
Concurrency stays serial in v1; the v2 unlock is a host-HEAD mutex, not a
component. Daemon code shrinks because env-specific branches collapse into
the protocol calls.

Captured the parallel pondering in `kb/notes-pondering-fleet.md` so it does
not block the env work: likely-drop of `brr eject`, lean toward a
single-file overlay (`~/.config/brr/overlay.md` appended to every prompt
rather than a multi-file lookup chain), self-maintaining registry under
`~/.local/state/brr/repos.json` for discovery without home-scanning, brnrd
as an agentic operator (separate project, hosted, uses the existing brr
file-protocol as its interface), cross-platform supervisor sketch
(systemd / launchd / docker), and a use-case table that grounds the
no-coordinator framing. Updated `kb/index.md` with both new pages.
No code changes; planning pass to drive the next implementation slice.
